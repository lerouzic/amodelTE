\section{Introduction}

Transposable elements (TEs) are repeated sequences that tend to accumulate in genomes, and often constitute a substantial part of eukaryotic DNA. In general, TE families are the most active upon their arrival in a new genome through a horizontal transfer; their copy number increases up to a maximum, at which point transposition stops. TE sequences are then progressively degraded and fragmented, accumulating sustitutions, insertions, and deletions, up to being undetectable and not identifiable as such. The reasons why the nature of TE families, the total TE content, and the number of copies per family vary substantially in the tree of life, even among close species, are far from being well-understood, which raises interesting challenges in comparative genomics. 

TEs spread in genomes by replicative transposition, which ensures both the genomic increase in copy number and the invasion of populations across generations of sexual reproduction \cite{CC83}. They are often cited as a typical example of selfish DNA sequences, as they can spread without bringing any selective advantage to the host species, and could even be deleterious \cite{OC80, DS80}. Even if an exponential amplification of a TE family could, in theory, lead to species extinction, empirical evidence rather suggests that TE invasion generally stops due to several (non-exclusive) physiological or evolutionary mechanisms, including selection, mutation, and regulation. Selection occurs whenever TE sequences are deleterious for the host species, as individuals carrying less TE copies will be favored by natural selection, and will thus reproduce preferentially, which tends to decrease the number of TE copies at the next generation. The mutation-control scenario relies on the degradation of the protein-coding sequence of TEs, which decreases the amount of functional transposition machinery (and thus the transposition rate) \cite{LCB07} \emph{(+ cite something about RIP?)}. Alternatively, substitutions or internal deletions in TEs could generate non-autonomous elements, able to use the transposition machinery without producing it, decreasing the transposition rate of autonomous copies \cite{LC06, RLZ+16}. Finally, transposition regulation refers to any mechanism involved in the control of the transposition rate of potentially functional TE sequences by the TE itself of by the host. 

\emph{Quick tour of known regulation mechanisms? Transcription silencing by methylation, alternative splicing (P element), OPI, etc.}. It has been recently confirmed that post-transcriptional TE silencing by small RNA was probably the most widespread and efficient TE regulation mechanism. \emph{Perhaps a quick presentation of the piwi pathway, + how widespread it is -- Drosophila, vertegrates, what about plants?}. 

If the strength of regulation increases with the copy number, the transposition rate is expected to drop in the course of the TE invasion up to the point where transposition stops. Nevertheless, the piwi regulation pathway displays unique features that may affect substantially the evolutionary dynamics of TE families: (i) it relies on a mutation-based mechanism, involving regulatory loci that may need several generations to appear (ii) the regulatory loci in the host genome segregate independently from the TE families and have their own evolutionary dynamics (the TE invades a genetically-heterogeneous populations, which are a mixture of permissive and repressive genetic backgrounds), and (iii) the regulation mechanism is irreversible (transposition does not occur again in low-copy number individuals). The consequences of these unique features on the TE invasion dynamics are not totally clear yet. Individual-based stochastic simulations have shown that (...  \cite{Kof19,KAZ18,CL10}). 


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Historical framework}

Model setting and notation traces back to \cite{CC83}, who proposed to track the average TE copy number $\bar n$ in a population through the difference equation:

\begin{equation}
\bar n_{t+1} = \bar n_t + \bar n_t(u - v),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $u$ is the transposition rate (more exactly, the amplification rate per copy and per generation), and $v$ the deletion rate. 
In this neutral model, if $u$ is constant, the dynamics is exponential. If the transposition rate $u_n$ is regulated by the copy number ($u_0 > v$, $d u_n / d n < 0$), $\overline{u_n} \simeq u_{\bar n}$, and $\mathrm{lim} (u_n) < v$, with $u_{\hat n} = v$, then a stable equilibrium copy number $\hat n$ can be reached. 

However, in most organisms, TEs are probably not neutral. If TEs are deleterious, fitness $w$ decreases with the copy number ($w_n < w_0$). As a consequence, individuals carrying more copies reproduces less, which decreases the average copy number every generation. The effect of selection can be accounted for using traditional quantitative genetics, considering the number of copies $n$ as a quantitative trait: $\Delta \bar n \simeq \mathrm{Var}(n) \mathrm d \log(w_n)/ \mathrm d n | \bar n$, where $\mathrm{Var}(n)$ is the variance in copy number in the population, and $\mathrm d \log(w_n)/ \mathrm d n | \bar n$  approximates the selection gradient on $n$. The approximation is better when the fitness function $w_n$ is smooth and the copy number $n$ is not close to 0. Assuming random mating and no linkage disequilibrium, $n$ is approximately Poisson-distributed in the population, and $\mathrm{Var}(n) \simeq \bar n$. 

\cite{CC83} propose to add up the effects of transposition and selection to approximate the variation in copy number across generations:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cc2}
\bar n_{t+1} \simeq \bar n_t(u_n - v) + \bar n \frac{d \log w_n}{d n} \Bigr|_{\bar n}.
\end{equation}

Equilibrium is reached when $\bar n_{t+1} = \bar n_t = \hat n$, which can be computed when the fitness function $w_n$ is known. 

\subsection{Numerical methods}

Model dynamics and data analysis was performed with R version 4.0 \citep{R20}. Model analysis was performed with packages deSolve \citep{SPS10}. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Neutral trap model} 

The model assumes $k$ identical piRNA clusters in the genome, and the total probability to transpose in a cluster region is $\pi$. Each cluster locus can harbor two alleles: a regulatory allele (i.e., the cluster carries a TE insertion), which segregates at frequency $p$, and an "empty" allele (frequency $1-p$). Allele frequencies at all clusters were considered to be the same (a consequence of the infinite population assumption). If the regulatory allele frequency at generation $t$ is $p_t$, the average number of cluster insertions for a diploid individual is $2kp_t$. Deletions were neglected ($v=0$). The presence of a single regulatory allele at any cluster was supposed to trigger complete regulation: the transposition rate per copy and per generation was $u$ in absence of regulation, and $0$ otherwise. Assuming random mating and no linkage disequilibrium (i.e.\ no correlation between $n$ and the genotype at the regulatory cluster),

\begin{align}\label{eq:basic}
\begin{split}
\Delta \bar n_t = n_{t+1} - n_t &= \bar n_t u (1-p_t)^{2k} \\
\Delta p_t = p_{t+1} - p_t &= \frac{\pi}{k}  \bar n_t u (1-p_t)^{2k}.
\end{split}
\end{align}

We approximated this discrete (non-overlapping) generation model with a continuous process, and the neutral model was rewritten as a set of two differential equations on $\bar n$ (relabelled $n$ for simplicity) and $p$:

\begin{align}\label{eq:neutral}
\begin{split}
\frac{\mathrm d n}{\mathrm d t} &= n u (1-p)^{2k} \\
\frac{\mathrm d p}{\mathrm d t} &= \frac{\pi}{k} n u (1-p)^{2k}.
\end{split}
\end{align}

Initial conditions were fixed to $n_0 = 1$ and $p_0 = 0$. 

The system admits three equilibria: $E_1: u = 0$ (no transposition), $E_2: \hat n = 0$ (loss of the transposable element), and $E_3: \hat p = 1$ (fixation of the regulatory cluster). Equilibria $E_1$ and $E_2$ do not deserve to be investigated further, as $u=0$, $n_0=0$, or $p_0=1$ do trivially result in the absence of any TE invasion. Equilibrium $E_3$ is analytically tractable, as $\mathrm d n / \mathrm d p = k/\pi$, and $n = n_0 + pk/\pi$ at any point of time. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eqneutral}
\begin{cases}
\hat n &= n_0 + k/\pi \\
\hat p &= 1.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Cluster fixation is asymptotic ($\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} p = 1$), and the equilibrium is asymptotically stable ($\mathrm d n /\mathrm d t > 0$ and $\mathrm d p/ \mathrm d t > 0$).

\end{figure}



\subsection{Selection}

Natural selection, by favoring the reproduction of genotypes with fewer TE copies, generally acts in the same direction as regulation. A piRNA regulation model implementing selection could be derived by combining equations \ref{eq:cc2} and \ref{eq:basic}. In order to simplify the analysis, we derived the results assuming that the deleterious effects of TE copies were independent, i.e.\ $w_n = \exp(- n s)$, where $n$ is the copy number and $s$ the coefficient of selection (deleterious effect per insertion), so that $\mathrm{d} \log w_n / \mathrm{d} n = -s$. 

Numerical simulations suggested that the approximation suggested by \citep{CC83} (equation~\ref{eq:cc2}), based on the independence of transposition and selection, was rather unconvincing when the transposition rate was high, typically, at the beginning of the dynamics. This discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that transposition overdisperses the copy number distribution compared to the theoretical Poisson: after transposition, the copy number rises to $\bar n = \bar n(1+u)$, while its variance becomes $\mathrm V(n) = \bar n (1+u)^2$. Neglecting terms in $u^2$, the apparent efficiency of selection $s^\prime$ thus seem to increase by a factor $1+2u$. Note that this correction is subtle and depends on model details (transposition before or after reproduction, immediate or delayed fitness penalty of new TE insertions). The correction $s^\prime \simeq s(1+2u)$ was used here solely to match the arbitrary modelling options of the simulation routine. 

The following relies on the additional assumption that $1-\pi \simeq 1$, (leading to $n \gg 2kp$, i.e.\ that the number of TE copies in the clusters is never large enough to make a difference in the total TE count). We will describe two selection scenarios that happened to lead to qualitatively different outcome: (i) TE insertions in pi-clusters are neutral, and (ii) TE insertions in pi-clusters are as deleterious as the other insertions. 

\paragraph{Deleterious TEs \& neutral clusters} If cluster TEs are neutral, the model becomes:

\begin{align}\label{eq:dtnc}
\begin{split}
\frac{\mathrm d n}{\mathrm d t} &= n u (1-p)^{2k} - n s^\prime \\
\frac{\mathrm d p}{\mathrm d t} &= \frac{\pi}{k} n u (1-p)^{2k}.
\end{split}
\end{align}

This equation only gives two equilibria, $E_2: \bar n = 0$, and $E_3: s^\prime=0$ and $p=1$, which is the same as for the neutral model (equation~\ref{eq:neutral}): no selection and fixation of all regulatory clusters. At the beginning of the dynamics, assuming $p_0 = 0$, the TE invades if $u > s^\prime$ (otherwise the system converges immediately to equilibrium $E_2$ and the TE is lost). The copy number increases ($\mathrm d n/\mathrm d t > 0$) up to a maximum $n^\ast$, which is achieved when $p=p^\ast$. The maximum copy number can be obtained analytically (Appendix~\ref{app:maxdtnc}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:maxdtnc}
\begin{split}
	p^\ast &= 1-\left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k} \\
	n^\ast &= n_0 + \frac{k}{\pi}\left[ 1- \frac{1}{2k-1} \left(2k\left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k} - \frac{s^\prime}{u}\right) \right].
\end{split}  
\end{equation}

Once the maximum number of copies is achieved, cluster copies keep on accumulating, decreasing the transposition rate, which leads to a decrease in the copy number, up to the loss of the the element ($\hat n = 0$ at equilibrium). At that stage, clusters are not fixed, and the equilibrium cluster frequency $\hat p$ can be expressed as a function of copy number and cluster frequency at the maximum ($p^\ast$ and $n^\ast$) (Appendix~\ref{app:exhatp}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:exhatp}
	\hat{p} - \frac{s^\prime}{u(2k-1)}\frac{1}{(1-\hat p)^{2k-1}} = p^\ast - \frac{s^\prime}{u(2k-1)}\frac{1}{(1-p^\ast)^{2k-1}} - \frac{\pi n^\ast}{k},
\end{equation}

\noindent from which an exact solution for $\hat p$ cannot be calculated. The approximation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:approxhatp}
	\hat p \simeq 1-\left[\frac{u}{s^\prime}(2k-1)p^\ast +1\right]^\frac{1}{1-2k}
\end{equation}

\noindent could be derived (Appendix~\ref{app:approxhatp}, and happened to be acceptable for a wide range of transposition rates (although less precise regarding the selection coefficient) (Figure~\ref{fig:figC2}).

\end{flushright}\end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Deleterious TEs and deleterious clusters} If the cluster insertions are as deleterious as other TEs, selection acts on cluster frequency as predicted by population genetics (assuming no dominance): 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:selps}
\begin{split}
\frac{\mathrm d n}{\mathrm d t} &= n u (1-p)^{2k} - n s^\prime \\
\frac{\mathrm d p}{\mathrm d t} &= \frac{\pi}{k} n u (1-p)^{2k} - s p \frac{1-p}{1- s p}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

This allows for a new equilibrium $E_4$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:selpseq}
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \hat n = \frac{k}{\pi}\frac{s}{s^\prime} \left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k}\frac{\hat p}{1-s\hat p} \\
\displaystyle \hat p = 1 - \left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The equilibrium exists ($\hat n > 0$ and $\hat p > 0$) whenever $s < u(1+2u)$, i.e.\ the transposition rate must be substantially larger than the selection coefficient.

\end{center}\end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

A linear stability analysis (Appendix~\ref{app:selpseq}) shows that for the whole range of $u$, $\pi$, and $k$, as well as for most of the reasonable values of $s$, the equilibrium is a stable focus, i.e.\ the system converges to the equilibrium while oscillating around it.

The purple line delineates $s = u/(1+2u)$, beyond which selection is too strong to let the TE invade (white area). }
\end{center}\end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Genetic drift}

The models described above assume infinite population sizes, which may not hold for low-census species (typically, mammals) and for laboratory (experimental evolution) populations. We assessed the influence of population size on the copy number with numerical simulations, comparing the neutral model, the deleterious TE - neutral cluster model, and the deleterious TE - deleterious cluster model with a "classical" copy-number regulation model in which $u_n = u_0/(1+kn)$. Since the deleterious TE - neutral cluster model does not allow for an equilibrium, comparisons had to be performed before the stabilization of the copy number (arbitrarily, at T=100 generations). Models were parameterized such that the copy number $n$ was approximately the same after 100 generations. Drift affects piRNA models substantially more than copy number regulation, the variance of all trap models being approximately one order of magnitude larger (Figure~\ref{fig:figH2}). The neutral trap model appears to be slightly more sensitive to drift. Consistently with population genetics theory, the variance across simulation replicates decreased with $1/N$ for all models. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{adjustwidth}{0in}{0in}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{../figures/figH2}
\caption{\label{fig:figH2} Variance in the average copy number (relative to the average copy number) at generation 100 among replicated simulations for various population sizes. Four models are displayed: neutral trap model, Deleterious TE - neutral clusters, Deleterious TE - deleterious cluster, and copy number regulation. The theoretically-expected decrease in variance (in $1/N$) is illustrated for the neutral piRNA model. }
\end{center}\end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

The standard population genetics theory predicts that selection is less effective at eliminating slightly deleterious alleles. Assuming that TE copies are deleterious, they should be eliminated faster in large populations compared to small ones. Although this mechanism has been proposed to explain the accumulation of junk DNA (including TE copies) in multicellular eukaryotes \citep{LC03}, little is known about how the equlibrium copy number of an active TE family is expected to be affected by drift even in the simplest scenarios \citep{CC83}. Yet, informal models suggest that drift may have a limited effect, as copy number equilibria rely on the assumption that evolutionary forces that limit TE amplification (regulation and/or selection) increase in intensity when the copy number increases. Thus, when drift pushes the average copy number up or down, TE amplification is expected to be less or more effective respectively, which compensates the random deviation. Simulations show that, whatever the model, the copy number is indeed slightly higher in small populations ($N < 100$) when the model involves selection, but this effect never exceeds 20\% of the total copy number (Figure~\ref{fig:figH1}). Overall, drift has a very limited impact on the copy number.

Transposition rates were: $u=0.045$ for the neutral model, $u=0.05$ for the Deleterious TE - neutral cluster model, $u=0.15$ for the Deleterious TE - Deleterious cluster model, and $u_n=0.17/(1+0.45 n)$ for the regulation model. }

\end{figure}


\section{Discussion}

The formalization of TE regulation by pi-RNA clusters (the "trap model") made it possible to derive a series of non-intuitive results, and evidence how trap regulation differs from traditional (copy-number based) regulation models. Among the most striking results: (i) in absence of selection (neutral trap model), the equilibrium copy number does not depend on the transposition rate, (ii) the efficiency of regulation increases with the size of clusters and decreases with the number of clusters, (iii) deleterious TEs can always invade when the transposition rate is larger than the selection coefficient, but the TE family can persist only if copies inserted in clusters are deleterious as well. Equilibria are always stable. Pi-RNA regulation being a mutational process, the TE copy number is substiantially more sensitive to genetic drift than other regulation models.

\section{Mathematical details}

\subsection{\label{app:maxdtnc} Equation \ref{eq:maxdtnc}}

When the copy number $n$ achieves its maximum $n^\ast$, $\mathrm d n/\mathrm d t = 0$. This happens when the cluster frequency $p^\ast$ is:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\frac{\mathrm d n}{\mathrm d t} &= n^\ast u (1-p^\ast)^{2k} - n^\ast s^\prime = 0 \\
	p^\ast &= 1 - \left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^{\frac{1}{2k}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The number of copies cumulated while $p$ is rising from $p_0$ to $p^\ast$ can be calculated by integrating both sides:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\frac{\mathrm d n}{\mathrm d p} &= \frac{k}{\pi}\left(1-\frac{s^\prime}{u(1-p)^{2k}}\right) \\
	\int_{n_0}^{n^\ast} \mathrm d n &=  \frac{k}{\pi} \left[\int_{p_0}^{p^\ast} \mathrm d p - \frac{s^\prime}{u} \int_{p_0}^{p^\ast} (1-p)^{-2k} \mathrm d p \right] \\
	n^\ast - n_0 &= \frac{k}{\pi}\left[p^\ast - p_0 - \frac{s^\prime}{u(2k-1)}((1-p^\ast)^{1-2k} - 1) \right] \\
	n^\ast &= n_0 + \frac{k}{\pi}\left[ p^\ast + \frac{s^\prime}{u(2k-1)}(1-(1-p^\ast)^{1-2k}) \right] \\
	n^\ast &= n_0 + \frac{k}{\pi}\left[ 1- \frac{1}{2k-1}\left(2k\left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k} - \frac{s^\prime}{u}\right) \right].
\end{split}  
\end{equation*}

\subsection{\label{app:exhatp} Equation \ref{eq:exhatp}}

The strategy was very similar than for obtaining $n^\ast$, with $\mathrm d p / \mathrm d n$ integrated both sides from the maximum to the equilibrium:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\int_{n^\ast}^{\hat n = 0} \mathrm d n &=  \frac{k}{\pi} \left[ \int_{p^\ast}^{\hat p} \mathrm d p - \frac{s^\prime}{u} \int_{p^\ast}^{\hat p} (1-p)^{-2k} \mathrm d p \right] \\
	-n^\ast &= \frac{k}{\pi}\left[(\hat p - p^\ast) - \frac{s^\prime}{u} \left( \frac{(1-\hat p)^{1-2k} - (1-p^\ast)^{1-2k}}{2k-1}\right)\right].
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{\label{app:approxhatp} Equation \ref{eq:approxhatp}}

Rewriting the previous equation with $\delta p = \hat p - p^\ast$ and $1-p^\ast = q^\ast$ gives:

\begin{equation*}
	-n^\ast = \frac{k}{\pi}\left[\delta p - \frac{s^\prime}{u(1-2k)} \frac{1}{(q^\ast - \delta p)^{2k-1}} - \frac{s^\prime}{u(1-2k)} {q^\ast}^{1-2k}\right],
\end{equation*}

\noindent which turns out to be dominated by the second term ($ 1/(q^\ast - \delta p)^{2k-1} \gg \delta p$ when $\delta p$ increases) for most parameter values. As a consequence, neglecting $\hat p - p^\ast$ leads to:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	n^\ast &\simeq \frac{k}{\pi}\left[\frac{s^\prime}{u} \left( \frac{(1-\hat p)^{1-2k} - (1-p^\ast)^{1-2k}}{2k-1}\right)\right] \\
	\Longleftrightarrow \hat p &\simeq 1- \left[ (1-p^\ast)^{1-2k} + \frac{\pi u (2k-1)}{s^\prime k} n^\ast \right]^\frac{1}{1-2k}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 

Replacing $p^\ast$ and $n^\ast$ with their expressions from equation~\ref{eq:maxdtnc} and reorganizing gives:
\begin{equation*}
		\hat p \simeq 1-\left[\frac{u}{s^\prime}(2k-1)(1+\frac{n_0 \pi}{k}-\left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k})+1\right]^\frac{1}{1-2k}.
\end{equation*}

Assuming that $n_0$ is reasonably small and $\pi \ll 1$, the term $n_0 \pi / k$ can be further neglected, and:
\begin{equation*}
		\hat p \simeq 1-\left[\frac{u}{s^\prime}(2k-1)(1-\left(\frac{s^\prime}{u}\right)^\frac{1}{2k})+1\right]^\frac{1}{1-2k}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{\label{app:selpseq} Equilibirum stability for equation \ref{eq:selpseq}}

The Jacobian matrix corressponding to the equilibrum~\ref{eq:selpseq} (using the shortcuts $\dot n = \mathrm d n / \mathrm d t $ and  $\dot p = \mathrm d p / \mathrm d t$) is:

\begin{equation*}
\bm J = 
   \begin{bmatrix}  \frac{\partial \dot n}{\partial n} &  \frac{\partial \dot n}{\partial p} \\[1em]
					\frac{\partial \dot p}{\partial n} &  \frac{\partial \dot p}{\partial p} \end{bmatrix} =
   \begin{bmatrix*}[l]
				0 & -2 k \hat n u \left( \frac{s^\prime}{u}\right) ^\frac{2k-1}{2k} \\[1em]
				\frac{\pi s^\prime}{k} & -2 \hat n u \pi \left( \frac{s^\prime}{u}\right) ^\frac{2k-1}{2k} + \frac{1-s}{(1-s \hat p)^2} - 1
	\end{bmatrix*}.
\end{equation*}

Eigenvalues are negative (i.e., the equilibrum is stable) for all tested parameter combinations. Eigenvalues happen to be complex for all parameter combinations, except for very large values of $s$, the equilibrium is thus a stable focus, reached asymptotically by oscillating around it.

Default parameter values were $u=0.1$, $s=0.01$, and $\pi=0.03$. The number of clusters ($k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=5$) is indicated by different line styles. Eigenvalues are complex for most of the range of the parameters, real part is in black, imaginary part is in blue. }
